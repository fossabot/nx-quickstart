# NxStarterTemplate

Welcome to NxStarterTemplate, a comprehensive starter template that integrates Nx, NestJS, Next.js, Prisma, and Typesafe REST using Ts-rest within a monorepo structure. This workspace empowers developers with a smart monorepo setup for efficient development and fast Continuous Integration (CI).

## Start the app

To start the development server run `pnpm run dev` or `npm run dev`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:nx   <...options>You can also run multiple targets:nx run-many -t  ..or add `-p` to filter specific projectsnx run-many -t   -p  Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ, and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
